## Bear Feeder

Welcome to Bear Feeder, a 2D Unity game programmed with C#. The goal of the game is to feed a bear with a spoon from a plate with the exact food that you rolled with a dice. The dice will randomly select one of three foods (Food 1, Food 2, Food 3) to be placed on the plate. You must use the spoon to feed the bear, but be careful - if the food falls from the spoon, it will not be counted towards the final score.

When all the food on the plate has been depleted, the game will count how much food landed in the bear's mouth and how much fell on the ground. If more food landed in the bear's mouth, you win the game. If more food fell on the ground, you lose.

To play the game, use the mouse or touch screen to control the spoon and feed the bear. Good luck and have fun!
